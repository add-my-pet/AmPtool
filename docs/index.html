    <H1 id="portaltop">AmPtool</H1>

    
    <a href = "http://www.github.com/add-my-pet/AmPtool/" target = "_blank">AmPtool</a> 
       contains Matlab functions for the visualisation and analysis of patterns in (functions of) parameter values of the Add-my-Pet (AmP) collection.
    It is an extension of <A HREF = "http://www.github.com/add-my-pet/DEBtool_M/" target = "_blank">DEBtool_M</A>, and makes frequent use of it.
    All parameters and traits, population traits and eco-codes for all entries are available in dropdown <code>COLLECTION/AmPdata</code>.
    Save these three files into one directory.
    Open Matlab and set paths to AmPtool, DEBtool_M (including subdirectories) and to the directory with the 3 <code>.mat</code> files. 
    Make sure to work with the latest versions.
    This page describes how to use AmPtool (in combination with DEBtool_M) for analysis of data in 4 stacked steps: 
      <a href = "#tree">tree</a>, <a href = "#selection">selections</a>, <a href = "#legend">legends</a> and <a href = "#plotting">plotting</a>.
    If you downloaded new <code>.mat</code> versions during a Matlab-session (rather than before the start), don't forget to <code>clear all</code> in Matlab.
    Subdirectory <code>curation</code> of AmPtool is only meant for curators to maintain the collection. 

    <H2 id="data">Data</H2>

    All data (i.e. meta-data, parameters, meta-parameters, 
      <A HREF = "https://add-my-pet.github.io/DEBtool_M/html/statistics_st.html" target = "_blank">implied traits</A>, 
      but no empirical data) of all entries are collected by function 
      <a href = "../curation/html/write_allStat.html" target = "_blank">write_allStat</a> into the Matlab-structure <b>allStat.mat</b>.
    Only curators who have all entries locally can run this function, but the result is <a href = "https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/AmPdata/AmPdata.zip" target = "_blank">downloadable on the AmP website</a>.
    To read data directly, use <code>load allStat</code>, or better <a href = "../html/read_allStat.html" target = "_blank" target = "_blank">read_allStat</a> for all entries, 
      or <a href = "../html/read_stat.html" target = "_blank">read_stat</a> for specified entries.
    The structure <code>allStat</code> has as first level field names the names of all entries, as specified by <a href = "../html/select.html" target = "_blank">select</a> (see below).
    As the AmP collection grows, lists-of-lists change (see below), so does <code>allStat</code>; these two should be seen as a couple that should not be uncoupled.
    All rates and times that are not primary parameters are given at temperature <code>T_typical</code>, which is entry-specific; 
      use temperature correction factor <code>c_T</code> to convert to the reference temperatures and temperature parameters to other temperatures.
    The primary parameters are given at <code>T_ref = 20</code> C, but only those with time in their dimensions depend on temperature.

    <p>
    All functions that analyse data read in <code>allStat</code>, using function 
      <a href="../html/read_allStat.html" target = "_blank">read_allStat</a> or <a href="../html/read_stat.html" target = "_blank">read_stat</a>.
    For example, (expected) gestation time <code>t_g</code> is given at <code>T_typical</code>; convert to temperature <code>T_ref</code> with
      <code>[var, nm] = read_allStat('t_g','c_T'); tg_Tref = var(:,1).*var(:,2);</code> and print to screen with <code>printpar(nm, tg_Tref)</code>.
    Oviparous species will have value <code>NaN</code> (Not-a-Number).
    Find all entries that have model <code>std</code> with <code>[model, nms] = read_allStat('model'); nms(strcmp('std', model))</code>.

    <p>
    Apart from <code>allStat</code>, the Matlab-structure <b>allEco.mat</b> exists for codes that specify climate, ecozone, habitat, embryo environment, 
      migration/torpor, food, gender and reproduction mode for each entry.
    The codes are explained in <a href="AmPeco.html" target = "_blank">AmPeco</a>, assigned by function 
      <a href="../curation/html/get_eco.html" target = "_blank">get_eco</a> and the Matlab-structure is written by  
      <a href="../curation/html/write_allEco.html" target = "_blank">write_allEco</a>.
    All functions that analyse data and read in <code>allEco</code> use function 
      <a href="../html/read_allEco.html" target = "_blank">read_allEco</a> or <a href="../html/read_eco.html" target = "_blank">read_eco</a>.
   
    <p>
    <a href = "../debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/pet/html/prt_report_my_pet.html" target = "_blank">prt_report_my_pet</a> can be used to get parameters and implied traits for specific entries.
    <code>prt_report_my_pet('Daphnia_magna');</code> will open an htlm-page in your browser, that allows for searching of traits and has the option "short/medium/long/pars".
    The "implied traits"-pages on the AmP-website present a subset of the shown list (but has no searching facilities).
    The function reads parameters in <code>allStat</code>  and specifies scaled functional response and temperature for each trait.
    The function is also used during the parameter estimation procedure for entries that are not yet in the collection with 
      <code>estim_options('results_output', 3);</code> in the <code>run_my_pet</code> file.
    In this application the data are not read from <code>allStat</code>, but computed from parameters, using the same routines that were used to obtain <code>allStat</code>.
    This is handy for checking that a particular parameter combination is yes or no realistic.
    With <code>estim_options('results_output', 4);</code>, related species are included in the report to compare parameters and implied traits.
    These related species in the collection are identified with function <a href="../html/clade.html" target = "_blank">clade</a> (see below), and if two or more related species are found, 
      color coding is applied to highlight eccentricity of values.

    <H2 id="tree">Taxonomic tree: lists-of-lists</H2>

    Entries are organised according to the taxonomic position of the taxa that they represent. 
    This position is determined in lists-of-lists; the taxonomic info in the mydata-files is only used for presentation in 
      the <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/species_list.html" target = "_blank">species-list</a> and 
      for the default value of the water content by function <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/pet/html/get_d_V.html" target = "_blank">get_d_V</a>
      and the default nitrogen waste by function <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/pet/html/get_N_waste.html" target = "_blank">get_N_waste</a>. 
    A list is a simple text-file in subdirectory taxa. 
    Several functions link these lists into a tree. 
    The tree has a root, here called <a href="../taxa/Animalia.txt">Animalia</a>, nodes, which are names of taxa, and leaves, which are names of entries.
    Most entries represent a species, but some species have multiple entries, such as geographical races. 
    Each node once occurs in a list and once as name of a list; the root only occurs once as a name of a list. 
    All entry (= leaf) names have an underscore in their name, while no node has an underscore.
    The last node (= list name) in tree-branches only contains leaves and is a genus, which is part of the name of the entries it contains. 
    No other node contains leaves.
    Function <a href="../html/list_taxa.html" target = "_blank">list_taxa</a> returns a list of all nodes and (optionally) leaves; you can also extract genera, families or phyla only.
    <code>list_taxa('Deuterostomata',4)</code> returns a list of all deuterostome families in the collection and <code>list_taxa('',7)</code> a list of all animal phyla.
    The species-sequence on the AmP web-pages <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/species_list.html" target = "_blank">species-list</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/species_tree_Animalia.html" target = "_blank">species-tree</a> is composed from this tree.

    <p>
    Compose your own interactive tree with <a href="../html/treeview_taxa.html" target = "_blank">treeview_taxa</a>, with any node as root, 
      including pictures on the nodes and links on the leaves, if you are web-connected, e.g. <code>treeview_taxa('Crustacea')</code>.
    It can also show the distribution of some statistic, i.e. parameter or implied trait, among the taxa in the (small) tree with background colour gradients.
    This statistic can be symbolic, with a name matching some field in <code>allStat</code>, or numeric, e.g. computed from values in <code>allStat</code>: 
      <code>treeview_taxa('Cladocera', 'kap')</code>.
    Function <a href="../html/select_taxon.html" target = "_blank">select_taxon</a> let you choose a taxon from a list of all possibilities.
    If you are not sure about the possible nodes, or want to avoid spelling errors: 
      <code>treeview_taxa(select_taxon('Arthropoda', 5))</code> let you choose from all arthropod orders.

    <p>
    The tree can be read in the direction from leaves to root with the function <a href="../html/lineage.html" target = "_blank">lineage</a>,
      and in the direction from root to leaves with the function <a href="../html/pedigree.html" target = "_blank">pedigree</a>. 
    The default input of pedigree is the root Animalia, but can also be any node, which becomes the root of the output-tree.
    The (character) string produced by pedigree can directly be printed to the screen, which is useful for small trees. 
    The tree can be used to identify useful taxa for analysis.

    <H2 class = "clear" id="selection">Selection of entries</H2>

    <h4>Selection on taxonomy</h4>

    A motivation for this type of selection could be to study evolutionary adaptations of parameter values and implied traits.
    Inclusion of very unrelated species in plots of traits typically results in a blurr that is not very informative.  
    Selection of entries via the tree is done with the functions <a href="../html/select.html" target = "_blank">select</a> and <a href="../html/select_01.html" target = "_blank">select_01</a>.
    Select returns a cell-string with names of selected entries, <code>select_01</code> a vector of booleans and a cell-string with the names of all entries.
    Notice that <code>allStat</code>, <code>allEco</code> and the lists-of-lists change continuously, so do the results of <code>select</code> and <code>select_01</code>.
    
    <p>
    Function <a href="../html/clade.html" target = "_blank">clade</a> finds the lowest taxon (node) that contains a set of specified taxa, and all its members.
    It combines functions <code>lineage</code> and <code>pedigree</code> and can also be used to find the closest relatives of a single specified taxon.
    If a species is not found in the AmP collection, 
    it searches the <a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/">Catalog of Life</a> and <a href="http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/">the Taxonomicon</a> for lineages, 
    with functions <a href="../html/lineage_CoL.html" target = "_blank">lineage_CoL</a> and <a href="../html/lineage_Taxo.html" target = "_blank">lineage_Taxo</a> and 
    presents the AmP species that are most related.

    <p>
    Print (compound) parameters or statistics of selected entries to screen with <a href="../html/prtStat.html" target = "_blank">prtStat</a>, or, 
      including the tree-structure, with <a href="../html/pedigree.html" target = "_blank">pedigree</a>.
    Use <a href="../html/clade.html" target = "_blank">clade</a> to select related entries and catenate with prtStat by e.g. <code>prtStat(clade('Lemmus_trimucronatus'),'p_M');</code>.<br>
    Include the tree as well by e.g. <code>[~, taxon] = clade('Lemmus_trimucronatus'); pedigree(taxon,'p_M')</code>.

    <h4>Selection on eco-codes</h4>

    A motivation for this type of selection could be to study ecological adaptations of parameter values.
    Selection on eco-codes is done with function <a href="../html/select_eco.html" target = "_blank">select_eco</a>. 
    It allows selection for a single variable, and multiple codes in OR mode.
    Apart from the names of the entries, it returns selection identifiers (booleans) for the whole collection, allowing to combine the result with multiple calls to this function.
    For example all species in the collection that eat invertebrates (in some stage) and occur in the North-Atlantic are found with: 
      <code>[nm, s1] = select_eco('food',{'Ci'}); [nm, s2] = select_eco('ecozone',{'MAN'}); nm = select; nm(s1&s2)</code>.
    While food-code <code>Cim</code> selects for feeding on molluscs, entries with code <code>Ci</code> will not be selected, but some of them might eat molluscs as well.
    In reverse, entries with code <code>Cim</code> will be selected if <code>Ci</code> is specified, due to the hierarchical nature of the coding system.
    Codes for one particular entry <code>my_pet</code> can be extracted with function <a href="../html/get_eco.html" target = "_blank">get_eco</a>: 
      <code>[climate, ecozone, habitat, embryo, migrate, food, gender, reprod] = get_eco(my_pet)</code>.
    Possible variables and codes are given on the <a href="AmPeco.html" target = "_blank" target="_blank">AmP ecology page</a>.
    Although the codes for food and habitat have stage-identifiers, they are presently not used in <code>select_eco</code>.
    Print, e.g. the value of reproduction efficiency <code>kap_R</code> for all entries that are simultaneous hermaphrodite: <code>prtStat(select_eco('gender','Hh'),'kap_R');</code>
    
    <h4>Selection on data types that were used for estimation</h4>

    A motivation for this type of selection could be to study effects of data combinations on the estimation process.
    Entries with a particular combination of <a href="http://www.debtheory.org/wiki/index.php?title=Zero-variate_data">zero-variate</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.debtheory.org/wiki/index.php?title=Univariate_data">uni-variate data</a> can be selected with function 
      <a href="../html/select_data.html" target = "_blank">select_data</a>.
    This selection can be restricted to particular <a href="http://www.debtheory.org/wiki/index.php?title=Typified_models">typified models</a>, 
      which can be handy for preparing a predict-file for a new species, and for linking parameter values to source data types.
    The Matlab expression <code>prtStat(select_data({'t-Le','Wwb'},'std'),'v');</code> prints entry names and their values for the energy conductance at 20 C 
      for all entries with standard (std) models that have the data time-length for embryos as well as wet weight at birth. 

    <h4>Selection on strings in mydata and predict files</h4>

     A motivation for this type of selection could be the question 'which entries have a changing (scaled) function response in time' and 
       which of these entries have  males and females with different parameters)? 
     The answer involves <a href="../html/select_predict.html" target = "_blank">select_predict</a>, using the knowlegde that such predict files make use of 
       the string 'f = spline1(t, tf)' and 'male', respectively. 
     The required code is <code>[species, nm] = select_predict('f = spline1(t, tf)'); select_predict(nm, 'males')</code>. 
     Notice that the default first argument of <code>select_predict</code> is absent in the first call (so 'Animalia' is assumed), but present in the second call. 
     Similarly, <a href="../html/select_mydata.html" target = "_blank">select_mydata</a> can be used for mydata files, e.g. to search for particular authors in references.

    <h4>Selection in general</h4>

    A general multi-step way of selecting entries on the basis of a variety of criteria is, e.g. mammals that have a <code>COMPLETE</code> score larger than 2.6: 
      <code>[s1,nm]=select_01('Mammalia');s2=read_allStat('COMPLETE')>2.6;nm=nm(s1&s2)</code>.
    Plot for those entries e.g. energy conductance as function of specific somatic maintenance <code>pM_v=read_stat(nm,'p_M','v')</code> with: 
      <code>Hfig=figure(1);plot(pM_v(:,1),pM_v(:,2),'or');</code>. See entry names by clicking on points in this figure with: 
      <code>h=datacursormode(Hfig);h.UpdateFcn=@(obj,event_obj)xylabels(obj,event_obj,nm,pM_v);datacursormode on</code>.
    Since the selection-booleans that result from <code>select</code>, <code>select_eco</code> and <code>select_data</code> all have the same sequence of entries, 
      the three types of selection can be combined.

    <p>
    <a href="../html/select_mydata.html" target = "_blank">select_mydata</a> and <a href="../html/select_predict.html" target = "_blank">select_predict</a> have selection-booleans as
       third output, which can be used for more advanced and/or conditions. 
    The code for answering the question 'which birds have males different from females or varying body temperature during development' could read
       <code>[x nm sel1] = select_predict('Aves','male'); [x nm sel2] = select_predict(nm,'del_l'); nm(sel1|sel2)</code>.
    

    <H2 id="legend">Legends exploit selections</H2>

    Spotting patterns in (functions of) parameters of entries starts with plot function <a href="../html/shstat.html" target = "_blank">shstat</a> 
      (see below; the name stands for "show statistics"), which has inputs data and legend (and optional further inputs).

    <p>
    A (marker) legend is a (n,2)-array of cells specifiying markers and taxa (= nodes and/or leaves as character strings) or eco-codes (as cell strings).
    A line legend, called <code>llegend</code>,  does this for lines and taxa; it is used for 1-variate data, e.g. survivor functions.
    Several legends are available as input-free functions that output the required cell-array, 
      such as <a href="../html/legend_RSED.html" target = "_blank">legend_RSED</a> and <a href="../html/legend_fish.html" target = "_blank">legend_fish</a>.
    Customised legends can be composed by functions 
      <a href="../html/select_legend.html" target = "_blank">select_legend</a>, <a href="../html/select_legend_eco.html" target = "_blank">select_legend_eco</a> and 
      <a href="../html/select_llegend.html" target = "_blank">select_llegend</a>.
    The choice of possible taxa is restricted to the ones present in the lists-of-lists and that of eco-codes to the codes mentioned in 
      <a href = "https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/AmPeco.html" target = "_blank">AmPeco</a>.
    Legends can be shown in a figure with DEBtool_M functions <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/misc/html/shlegend.html" target = "_blank">shlegend</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/misc/html/shllegend.html" target = "_blank">shllegend</a>.
    Please notice that the sequence of rows of marker legends matters, see <a href="../html/shstat.html" target = "_blank">shstat</a>;
      this is a consequence of the fact that one taxon can contain another one.

    <H2 id="plotting">Spotting patterns in data with legends</H2>

    Function <a href="../html/shstat.html" target = "_blank">shstat</a> can be used in symbolic mode for 1-, 2- and 3-variate data, as given in <code>allStat</code>.
    In this mode, shstat is using <code>read_allStat</code> to read in <code>allStat</code>; 
      a large number of symbols for (functions of) parameters is available, following <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy2010_n.pdf">DEB notation</a>.
    Functions of parameters that do not depend on food, called compound parameters, were computed with DEBtool_M function 
      <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/pet/html/parscomp_st.html" target = "_blank">parscomp_st</a>,
      and that do  with 
      <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/pet/html/statistics_st.html" target = "_blank">statistics_st</a>.
    These functions briefly describe the various variables, which are presented in context in the <a href="http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy2010.pdf">DEB book</a>.

    <p>
    Function <code>shstat</code> can also be used in numerical mode in the case that computations are required, 
      e.g. for functions of parameters that are not already in <code>allStat</code>.
    In this case, shstat does not read in <code>allStat</code>, but still links data to entries via legends.

    <p>
    Markers in plots can be clicked to show the names of the corresponding entries.
    The script <a href="../mydata_shstat.m">mydata_shstat</a> gives examples of use of <code>shstat</code> and 
      shows how items can be added to figures that have been produced by shstat.
    If markers in 3D plots do not have color specifications, the third variable is used to set the colors in the lava color scheme, see
    <A HREF = "http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/misc/html/shcolor_lava.html" target = "_blank">shcolor_lava</A>, using
    <A HREF = "http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/lib/misc/html/color_lava.html" target = "_blank">color_lava</A>.
