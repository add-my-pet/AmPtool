% created 2017/04/07 by Bas Kooijman

%% Syntax
% <../check_jpg.m *check_jpg*>(info)

%% Description
% checks presence jpg's for nodes in the tree 
%
% Input:
%
% * info: optional scalar (default 0) with 
%
%     - 0 check tree against local
%     - 1 check local against server
%     - 2 check tree against local and local against server
%
% Output:
% 
% * prints warnings on screen

%% Remarks
% The root of the tree is Animalia
% Assumes that this function is ran in dir AmPtool/curation and that entries is a sister directory of AmPtool
% Assumes that jpg's and txt's are in sister directory img/tree of AmPtool
% Assumes that path to jpg's on server is: http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/img/tree
% All files in img/tree must have extension '.jpg' or '.jpg.txt'
